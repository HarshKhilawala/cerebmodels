Welcome to CerebModels-CerebUnit's documentation (CerebModels component)!
=========================================================================

Models of cerebellum covers various modeling scales; cells to network level. Validation of each models is based on the `SciUnit <https://github.com/scidash/sciunit>`_ framework. This is the basis for `CerebUnit <https://github.com/myHBPwork/cerebunit>`_.

The workflow has been designed such that the models, `CerebModels <https://github.com/myHBPwork/cerebmodels>`_ are separate from the validation tests in `CerebUnit <https://github.com/myHBPwork/cerebunit>`_.

This is the documentation for the **CerebModels** component.
